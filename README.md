# Red Lab Framework

Ethical boundary testing framework for LLM sessions with safety protocols.

## Overview

Red Lab provides structured methodology for conducting controlled testing of LLM edge cases while maintaining safety through:
- Entry/exit protocols
- Safety anchors and rollback mechanisms  
- Drift detection and telemetry
- Definition of Done (DoD) validation gates

## Core Components

### Session Manifest
Defines risk level, participants, safety measures, timeouts

### Safety Protocols
- Anchors (symbolic safety markers)
- Rollback keys (emergency restore)
- Safewords
- Automatic session limits

### DoD Gates
Every response validated for:
- Explicit content (no ellipsis)
- Clear units/values
- Verifiable outputs

### Telemetry
- Content drift tracking
- Response latency monitoring
- Boundary violation logging

## Status

Experimental framework in active development.
